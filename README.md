<h1>GitHub Repo Gallery</h1> 

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Simple website that allows viewers to see my GitHub repos easily. Visitors can view and access my repos to get more detail on the various projects I have worked on. 
	While creating the GitHub Repo Gallery, I used the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">GitHub API</a> to pull data from my GitHub account. 
	By using the GitHub API, I am able to pull data, such as my name, bio, location, and the number of public repos on my GitHub account. Visitors can utilize the dynamic
	search box to find my repos by name, clicking on the link to find more information on that specific repo.</p>

 <h3>How to Use the GitHub Gallery</h3>
 <p>The best way to use the Gallery is to scroll through the page and look at the names of the repos. Once you find a repo that interests you, click on the name, it will 
	 open up in a new page and you can read the Name, Description, Default Branch and Langauges used.</p> 
	
 <p>Once you click on a repo, you will see two buttons, "View Repo on GitHub" (purple button with white letters) and "Back to Repo Gallery" (white button with black letters). 
	 The "View Repo on GitHub" button allows you to view the repo on the GitHub website. Once there, you can scroll through the code and other features. The "Back to Repo 
	 Gallery" button allows you to go back to the main page of the GitHub Gallery website. Making it easy to access other repos.</p>

 <p>If you happen to know the name of the repo you are looking for, you can type the name in the search box and will quickly pull up the repo you are looking for.</p>
